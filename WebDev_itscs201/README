Summary

    Source code for New Beginnings 2016 Final Term Project -  
    Version 0.1

Requirements

Clone the git repository into a place that you will run from. For example, /var/www/html.    
If you don't have git....   
       sudo apt-get install git   
       cd /var/www/   
       git clone https://<username>@bitbucket.org/llawrens/itscs201.git  

This will create /var/www/itscs201/{www,templates}. The intructions assume this setup,   
but it's obvious where changes should be made if you do not wish to name things this way.  

To ensure all of the necessary software is available, install the following packages and the extras it asks for.   
They are necessary for the Python-Flask web interface, etc ...  
      sudo apt-get install python-pip 
      sudo apt-get install python-virtualenv  

To create the Python virtualenv, do:   
      cd www  
      mkdir env 
      virtualenv -p python3 env   
      source env/bin/activate  

Within the environment, install flask, and lockfile using these commands...   
      pip install flask 
      pip install lockfile  

Configure the web server,  
	Move etc/apache2/sites-available/itscs201.conf to the appropriate  
		place (/etc/apache2/sites-available/itscs201.conf) and  
		edit the file to reflect your local configuration  
		(i.e. ServerName, ServerAlias, WSGI path settings)  
	Edit www/app.wsgi to point to where your web files are  

	Enable the site  
		sudo a2enmod wsgi (if necessary)  
		sudo a2ensite itscs201  
		sudo service apache2 restart  

	If you have permission errors, ensure that your directories
		are readable by apache2 (www-data)

For creating database for individual users :    
      cd scripts  
Update the file "userlist" with the list of usernames and passwords to access the application, one username-password per line delimited by space and then run the make.  
      make
This will create databases in the itscs201/db directory for each user in the userlist. It will also update the www/users.py with the username/password needed to access the application.  

If  you want to clear up the databases created for users, run the following :  
     cd scripts
     make clean
